# Bitcoin network

The aim of this project is to design and simulate a network in which the participants transact bitcoins like in the real world. Although the project doesn't address all the requirements, it surely covers the trivial parts of the bitcoin network. It is necessary to first understand what a bitcoin is and the technology on which the bitcoin has been developed. Following are few links that can be followed to gain an insight of this mysterious and often misunderstood cryptocurrency.

## Steps to run the project

I have used Visual studio code as editor while coding for this project. It has an built in support for syntax and filling suggestion for Elixir. This can be got by installing an additional package along with Visual studio code.

You should have [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) and [Phoenix framework](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html) installed on your system to run the following project on your system. Clone this repository into your system and run the following commands

`mix phx.new somefilename`
